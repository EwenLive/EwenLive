# Hey there! 👋

I’m **Ewen Croizier**, an **Automation & Backend Developer** based in France.
I build systems that turn complex manual tasks into efficient, automated workflows.
If I see a repetitive process, chances are I’ll build a script or a workflow to fix it.

My main tech stack is **Python (FastAPI)**, **n8n**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Docker**. 
My favorite tools are **VS Code** and **Supabase**.

I’ve got several projects pinned below, but my favorite is the **invoicing-app** — a full-scale automation for Shopify stores.

I’m currently available for freelance missions on **[Malt](https://www.malt.fr/profile/ewencroizier)**!
